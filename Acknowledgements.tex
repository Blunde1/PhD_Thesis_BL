I would like to thank my supervisor, Professor Tore Selland Kleppe, for his constant support and invaluable guidance. You have allowed me to 
pursue ideas, to fail, and so many times steered me in the right direction with detailed feedback and questions that would uncover flaws, but which would eventually lead me closer towards truth.
Thank you for your encouraging words, enthusiasm and genuine thoughtfulness.

Thanks are also due to my co-supervisors, the professors Hans Julius Skaug and Jan Terje Kvaløy.
Professor Skaug has co-authored two of the papers in this thesis, introduced me to the statistics community in Bergen, and always shared of his time and wide experience, for this I am grateful.
Professor Kvaløy has been presence of constant cheerfulness and inspiration. Thank you for always taking a genuine interest in people and their ideas.
I extend my thanks to my fellow PhD-students. Utmost appreciation goes out to Kjartan Kloster Osmundsen and Birthe Aarekol, for the many discussions and several enjoyable trips to academic conferences and meetings around the world.

% TAKK KJETIL!!!

Finally, I want to give many thanks to my friends, in particular and utmost to Kjetil, having accommodated me in Stavanger, and allowed me with his companionship to escape stress. And also my family, in particular my mother, Katrin, for invaluable advice, and my wife, Saeron Min, which has been a force of continued support. 
You have let me dive into hours of silent thoughts, calculations and coding when it was needed, but have also pulled me away and forced upon me a more balanced life when I would encounter a runtime error of the mind, but of the kind which I would not be able to see or solve by myself.
